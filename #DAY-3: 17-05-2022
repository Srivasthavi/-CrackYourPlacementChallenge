#DAY-3: 17-05-2022

PROBLEM_1:BEST TIME TO BUY AND SELL STOCK-II
  You are given an integer array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.
  On each day, you may decide to buy and/or sell the stock. You can only hold at most one share of the stock at any time. However, you can buy it then immediately sell it on the same day.
  Find and return the maximum profit you can achieve.
  Example 1:
  Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
  Output: 7
  Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
  Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-3 = 3.
  Total profit is 4 + 3 = 7.
  
  CODE:
  class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        pr = 0
        for i in range(1, len(prices)):
            if prices[i]>prices[i-1]:
                p = prices[i] - prices[i-1]
                pr+=p
        return pr
                    
                
    EXPLANATION:
    1. First we parse through the list and check if the previous value is grater than the present value if it is then we find the profit obtained and add it to the total profit and return it.
    
PROBLEM_2: FIND ALL DUPLICATES
  Given an integer array nums of length n where all the integers of nums are in the range [1, n] and each integer appears once or twice, return an array of all the integers that appears twice.
  You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time and uses only constant extra space.
  Example 1:
   Input: nums = [4,3,2,7,8,2,3,1]
  Output: [2,3]
  
  CODE:
  class Solution:
    def findDuplicates(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        u=set()
        d=[]
        while nums:
            num = nums.pop()
            if num not in u:
                u.add(num)
            else:
                d.append(num)
        return d
        
        
    EXPLANATION:
    1. we first make one empty set and empty list.
    2. now we go through the list from the end by popping each elemetn while we check it 
    3. if its not in the unique set of elements(count=1) then we add it to that set otherwise it means count=2 hence we add it to the list and return the list
